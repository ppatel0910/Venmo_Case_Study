# **A Deep Dive Into Venmo**

## Overview and Origin
### What is the name of the company?
Venmo is a peer to peer payment service company owned by Paypal. The current valuation for Venmo is $38 billion dollars.

### When was the company incorporated?
Venmo was founded in August 2009, and was publicly launched in March 2012.

### Who are the founders of the company?
Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail are co-founders of Venmo. They originally met freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania. They were assigned as random roommates, and the pair were both studying computer science at the start of college. Although Kortina ended up studying in “Philosophy and Creative Writing and minors in Computer Science and Logic”, he kept an interest in computer science.

### How did the idea for the company come about?
Upon graduation, Kortina and Magdon-Ismail built websites for small businesses in West Philly. Simultaneously during this period the pair worked on startup projects such as “a realtime
website analytics tool called Swooge and a web based music selling platform, Philafunk.” Kortina moved on to work at Betaworks, and Magdon-Ismail worked for Ticketleap. Both were ready to work on a project of their own, which led to them meeting on the weekends to work on potential ideas.The idea for the company was born when Magdon-Ismail visited Kortina in New York City, and forgot his wallet in Philadelphia. Kortina paid for Magdon-Ismail expenses for the weekend, and Magdon-Ismail paid Kortina back via check. The process of writing and later depositing the check was a nuisance to both parties, which led both to believe there should be a better way to send money to each other. Paypal was available, but not utilized by the pair or any of their friends. The duo set out to solve this problem, which led to the first prototype of Venmo which was through SMS.
